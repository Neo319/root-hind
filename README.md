Creating a landing page website using HTML and CSS alongside The Odin Project (TOP).

This project focuses especially on the use of flexbox to create aesthetic webpages. I implemented my own photos and tried to make this project stand out.
This page does not function yet on phones or vertical windows -- this comes next in the TOP curriculum.
